Interface linking excel and Shlumberger PIPESIM modelling software (using provided 'OpenLink' API).

Purpose of the code was to generate & run models then extract data (work in progress) from PIPESIM without needing to use the PIPESIM GUI at any stage - with the aim of improving work efficiency.

All code written by me, with occasional Schlumberger example code used as a basis.
